## 1. Overview
This project implements a role-based company management and performance review system using **Django + Django REST Framework**.  

It provides:  
- Management of companies, departments, and employees.  
- Role-based access control for different user types (Admin, HR, Manager, Employee).  
- A performance review workflow (assign ‚Üí confirm ‚Üí feedback ‚Üí approval/rejection).  
- JWT authentication for secure access.  
- SQLite database for development and testing.

## 2. Project Setup ‚öôÔ∏è

### Installation

1. **Make sure you have Python 3.10+ installed**

2. **Create an empty folder, within it create a Python virtual environment:**

   ```bash
   python -m venv django-env
   ```

3. **Clone this repository to your local machine:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mohamed-Senary/Brainwise-Task.git
   cd Brainwise-Task
   ```

4. **Activate the Python virtual environment:**

   ```bash
   # Windows
   ../django-env/Scripts/Activate
   
   # Linux/macOS
   source ../django-env/bin/activate
   ```

5. **Install the necessary requirements:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

6. **Make migrations and migrate the database:**

   ```bash
   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

7. **Run the application server locally:**

   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

8. **Follow the link in the terminal** (usually `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`)

9. **Check the API documentation** for the different endpoints

## 3. Implementation Details

### üîπ Accounts App  
- Custom user model (`UserAccount`) with four roles: **Admin**, **HR**, **Manager**, **Employee** and Sign in Using email not username.
- Encode role in JWT token
- Registeration and SignIn functionalities  
- Provides the base authentication and role definitions.  
- Role-based permissions (`IsAdmin`, `IsHR`, `IsManager`, `IsEmployee`) implemented here.
#### Permissions Matrix:
| Entity / Action | Admin | Manager | HR | Employee |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| View Company | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |  | ‚ùå |
| View Dept | ‚úÖ |  | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå |
| Employee (CRUD) | ‚úÖ Full | View Only | ‚úÖ Full | ‚ùå |
| Performance Review | ‚ùå | Approve / Reject only | Create, Schedule, Provide Feedback, Push for Approval | View own review, Accept |  

### üîπ Company App  
- Responsible for managing **companies, departments, and employees**.  
- CRUD endpoints provided for companies and departments.  
- Employees can be listed, created, retrieved, updated, and deleted.  
- Supports filtering employees by `company` and/or `department` via query parameters.  
  - Example:  
    - `/api/company/employee/?company=1`  
    - `/api/company/employee/?department=2`  
    - `/api/company/employee/?company=1&department=2`  

### üîπ Reviews App  
- Responsible for managing **performance reviews**.  
- `PerformanceReview` model added to represent review lifecycle.  
- Workflow transitions:  
  - `PENDING ‚Üí SCHEDULED` (employee confirms)  
  - `SCHEDULED ‚Üí FEEDBACK_PROVIDED` (HR provides feedback)  
  - `FEEDBACK_PROVIDED ‚Üí UNDER_APPROVAL` (HR pushes forward)  
  - `UNDER_APPROVAL ‚Üí APPROVED/REJECTED` (Manager decides)

## 4. Assumptions & Considerations
- Employees are treated as a **manageable entity** (model `Employee`) rather than being tied directly to `UserAccount` via foreign key.  
- A `PerformanceReview` model was introduced (not explicitly in requirements) to manage workflow and state transitions.  
- **HR role clarified**: HR schedules and provides feedback, while Managers handle approvals/rejections.  
- **HR employees** do not receive performance reviews themselves (assumed).  
- Only HR/Admin can create employees (restricted at view level).  
- Managers cannot create or edit employees.  

---

## 5. Security Measures
- **JWT authentication**: all endpoints protected by token-based auth.  
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: enforced through custom permission classes.  
- Sensitive actions (creating employees, assigning reviews, approving/rejecting) are strictly tied to roles.
