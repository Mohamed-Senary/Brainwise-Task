## 1. Overview  
This project implements a role-based company management and performance review system using **Django + Django REST Framework**.  

It provides:  
- Management of companies, departments, and employees.  
- Role-based access control for different user types (Admin, HR, Manager, Employee).  
- A performance review workflow (assign ‚Üí confirm ‚Üí feedback ‚Üí approval/rejection).  
- JWT authentication for secure access.  
- SQLite database for development and testing.

## 3. Implementation Details  

### üîπ Accounts App  
- Custom user model (`UserAccount`) with four roles: **Admin**, **HR**, **Manager**, **Employee**.  
- Provides the base authentication and role definitions.  
- Role-based permissions (`IsAdmin`, `IsHR`, `IsManager`, `IsEmployee`) implemented here.  

### üîπ Company App  
- Responsible for managing **companies, departments, and employees**.  
- CRUD endpoints provided for companies and departments.  
- Employees can be listed, created, retrieved, updated, and deleted.  
- Supports filtering employees by `company` and/or `department` via query parameters.  
  - Example:  
    - `/api/company/employee/?company=1`  
    - `/api/company/employee/?department=2`  
    - `/api/company/employee/?company=1&department=2`  

### üîπ Reviews App  
- Responsible for managing **performance reviews**.  
- `PerformanceReview` model added to represent review lifecycle.  
- Workflow transitions:  
  - `PENDING ‚Üí SCHEDULED` (employee confirms)  
  - `SCHEDULED ‚Üí FEEDBACK_PROVIDED` (HR provides feedback)  
  - `FEEDBACK_PROVIDED ‚Üí UNDER_APPROVAL` (HR pushes forward)  
  - `UNDER_APPROVAL ‚Üí APPROVED/REJECTED` (Manager decides)  
 

---

## 4. Assumptions & Considerations  
- Employees are treated as a **manageable entity** (model `Employee`) rather than being tied directly to `UserAccount` via foreign key.  
- A `PerformanceReview` model was introduced (not explicitly in requirements) to manage workflow and state transitions.  
- **HR role clarified**: HR schedules and provides feedback, while Managers handle approvals/rejections.  
- **HR employees** do not receive performance reviews themselves (assumed).  
- Only HR/Admin can create employees (restricted at view level).  
- Managers cannot create or edit employees.  

---

## 5. Security Measures  
- **JWT authentication**: all endpoints protected by token-based auth.  
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: enforced through custom permission classes.  
- Sensitive actions (creating employees, assigning reviews, approving/rejecting) are strictly tied to roles.
